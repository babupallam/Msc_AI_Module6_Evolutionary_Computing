In this code: Real GA
    Selection: Fitness Proportionate Selection Operator
    Crossover: Uniform Crossover Operator -- coulndt fine it in lecture slides
    Mutation: Global Mutaion
    Survivor Selectiojn: mu+lambda survivor selction has been used here


The operator changednin this algorithm:

Note: I have changed the given code acoording to the conveniance, in order to seperate the operators into different sections

1. selection: 
    1. Binary tournament Selection
    2. Stochastic Universal Sampling --- already implemented in binary GA
    3. Stochastic Remainder Rolette Fitness Algorithm --- already implemented in Binary GA
2. Crossover: 
    1. Uniform Crossover --- alreadyn there in the given code
    2. SBX Crossover Operator
    3. Linear Crossover Operator
    4. Fuzzy Recombination Operator
    5. Unimodal Normal Distribution Crossover Operator
2. Mutation: 
    1. Polinomial Mutation Operator
    2. Random Mutation Operator
    3. Non Uniform Opeartor
    4. Normal Distribution Mutation Operator
